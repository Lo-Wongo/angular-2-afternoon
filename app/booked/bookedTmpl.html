<!-- Now that the bookedCtrl.js is setup, we can now add the package's city and country to the DOM. 
We'll also add a ng-style to the parent section element to set the background-image to the package's image. 
When using ng-style the syntax follows: { 'css-property': 'css-value' }. You can use {{}} to insert $scope.values into ng-style -->

<!-- We'll also want to add an ng-if to the section element. This way, the element wont be rendered until $scope.package exists. 
Otherwise, our ng-style won't work correctly. To add an ng-if we add it to an element as an attribute and assign it an expression. 
We can do a simple truthy check for $scope.package -->

<!-- Finally, we'll need to update the ui-sref in app.js to link to the correct packages route. 
      If we look in app/app.js, in our router configuration, we'll see that the packages route is expecting a country parameter. 
      Also, if we take a look at our data in mainSrvc we can see that our package objects have a property called country.
Therefore, we can use {{ package.country }} in the DOM to fix our ui-sref link 
To add parameters in a ui-sref all we need to do is add ({ paramName: paramValue }) next to the route name.  -->
