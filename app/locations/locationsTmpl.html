<!-- Now that our controller is setup, we can repeat through locations on the DOM. 
We'll want to update the ng-src here to be the location's image and the alt to be the location's country on the img element. 
We'll also want to update the h1 element to have a value of the location's country and update the p element to have a value of the location's desc -->

<!-- Lastly, we'll need to fix the ui-sref so that it properly calls the packages route with the location's country -->
